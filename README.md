# Random Quotes


## The JavaScript:
- DOM manipulation 
- objects
- functions.


## About this project:
<p>This project can be created in many ways. But I was interested in learning how to solve it using an object, a data structure that is undeservedly not often used.</p>

<p>While working on this project, I also learned a simple algorithm responsible for generating a random quote when a button is clicked.</p>
